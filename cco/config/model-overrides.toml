# CCO Model Override Configuration
#
# This configuration enables transparent model rewriting at the proxy layer.
# When Claude Code sends a request for a specific model, the proxy can override it.
#
# Use case: Cost optimization by routing expensive models to cheaper alternatives
# Example: Route all "sonnet" requests to "haiku" for 75% cost savings
#

[overrides]
# Enable or disable model overrides globally
enabled = true

# Model rewrite rules
# Format: "original_model" = "replacement_model"
# The proxy will rewrite any request for the original model to use the replacement
rules = [
    # Sonnet → Haiku rewrites (75% cost savings)
    ["claude-sonnet-4.5-20250929", "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"],
    ["claude-sonnet-4", "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"],
    ["claude-sonnet-3.5", "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"],

    # Opus → Sonnet rewrites (75% cost savings)
    # ["claude-opus-4-1-20250805", "claude-sonnet-4.5-20250929"],

    # Add your own rules below:
    # ["original-model", "replacement-model"],
]

# Logging and analytics configuration
[analytics]
# Log all model overrides to console
log_overrides = true

# Track override statistics (useful for cost analysis)
track_statistics = true

# Report format options: "json", "text", "silent"
report_format = "json"

[per_model_rules]
# You can specify different override behavior per model
# This is useful for fine-grained control

# Example: Only override sonnet during business hours
# "claude-sonnet-4.5-20250929" = {
#     "override_to" = "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",
#     "conditions" = {
#         "time_window" = "business_hours"  # future enhancement
#     }
# }

[override_statistics]
# These are populated at runtime by the proxy
# Shows what overrides have been applied and their effectiveness

# Example output:
# original_model = "claude-sonnet-4.5"
# override_to = "claude-haiku-4-5"
# requests_rewritten = 42
# cost_saved = "$18.50"
# percentage_saved = "68%"
