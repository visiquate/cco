================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE METHODS
================================================================================

METHOD 2 - GitHub Actions Workflow:
gh workflow run setup-build-tools.yml -R langstons/cco --ref main
Time: 15-20 minutes (includes GitHub indexing delay)
Status: Workflows pushed to repository, awaiting GitHub indexing

METHOD 3 - Manual Batch Commands:
ssh root@192.168.9.220
for CTID in {200..208}; do
  pct exec $CTID -- apt-get update -qq
  pct exec $CTID -- apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev protobuf-compiler
done
Time: 5-10 minutes
Control: Full transparency

================================================================================
VERIFICATION PROCEDURES
================================================================================

AFTER INSTALLATION, VERIFY:

1. Check runners still online:
   gh api orgs/langstons/actions/runners --jq '.runners | length'
   Expected: 9

2. Check individual runner status:
   gh api orgs/langstons/actions/runners --jq '.runners[] | {name, status}'
   Expected: All showing "online"

3. Verify tools on one runner (manual check):
   ssh root@192.168.9.220
   pct exec 200 -- gcc --version
   pct exec 200 -- make --version
   pct exec 200 -- pkg-config --version
   pct exec 200 -- protoc --version

4. Test Rust compilation:
   gh workflow run build.yml -R langstons/cco --ref main
   gh run watch -R langstons/cco
   Expected: Successful build with all tools available

================================================================================
SUCCESS CRITERIA
================================================================================

Installation is successful when ALL of the following are true:

  ✓ All 9 runners online (status: online)
  ✓ build-essential installed on all runners
  ✓ pkg-config installed on all runners
  ✓ libssl-dev installed on all runners
  ✓ protobuf-compiler installed on all runners
  ✓ gcc executable and working
  ✓ make executable and working
  ✓ pkg-config executable and working
  ✓ protoc executable and working
  ✓ Rust cargo can compile projects
  ✓ Release workflow succeeds

Expected Outcome: All criteria met within 15 minutes total

================================================================================
EXECUTION TIMELINE
================================================================================

Timeline with Recommended Method:

Minute 0:   Decision made to execute
Minute 1:   SSH to Proxmox + start script
Minute 2-7: Installation on all 9 runners (parallel)
Minute 8:   Verification and testing
Minute 10:  All runners ready for Rust builds
Minute 15:  Release workflow tests passing

Total Time: Approximately 10-15 minutes

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS AFTER INSTALLATION
================================================================================

1. VERIFY INSTALLATION (5 minutes)
   - Check all runners still online
   - Verify each tool is installed
   - Test with sample build

2. TEST RUST COMPILATION (5 minutes)
   - Trigger build.yml workflow
   - Verify successful completion
   - Check compilation speed

3. RELEASE WORKFLOW TEST (5 minutes)
   - Trigger release workflow
   - Verify artifacts generated
   - Confirm binary builds work

4. PRODUCTION READINESS (Done)
   - All 9 runners configured
   - Build tools ready
   - Release process functional

================================================================================
DECISION REQUIRED
================================================================================

Which execution method to use?

[ ] A - PROXMOX (RECOMMENDED - NOW)
    Command: ssh root@192.168.9.220 bash /tmp/deploy-build-tools-to-runners.sh
    Time: 5-10 minutes
    Reliability: Maximum
    Recommendation: USE THIS NOW

[ ] B - GITHUB ACTIONS (Wait for indexing)
    Command: gh workflow run setup-build-tools.yml -R langstons/cco --ref main
    Time: 15-20 minutes
    Reliability: High (after indexing)
    Note: Automated, good for future maintenance

[ ] C - MANUAL BATCH (Manual control)
    Commands: SSH loop executing apt-get on each container
    Time: 5-10 minutes
    Reliability: Maximum
    Note: Full transparency, no scripts

STRONG RECOMMENDATION: Choose Option A (Proxmox Method)
  • Fastest immediate execution
  • Most direct and reliable
  • No GitHub delays or dependencies
  • Can use GitHub Actions for daily maintenance after initial setup

================================================================================
SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

COMMON ISSUES:

Issue: GitHub workflow not appearing
  Solution: Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub indexing, then retry

Issue: Installation hangs on specific package
  Solution: Check network connectivity and disk space on runner

Issue: Proxmox connection fails
  Solution: Verify SSH key and access to 192.168.9.220

FALLBACK PROCEDURES:

If Proxmox script fails:
  1. Test single container first
  2. Check network and disk space
  3. Retry with manual commands

If GitHub Actions not ready:
  1. Use Proxmox method immediately
  2. GitHub workflow can be used for daily maintenance

If single runner fails:
  1. Investigate specific container
  2. Manual install on that container
  3. Retry others

See documentation for full troubleshooting guides.

================================================================================
