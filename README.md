# Claude Orchestra 🤖⚔️

A sophisticated multi-agent development system powered by Claude Code, featuring specialized coding agents, an architect for strategic decisions, and support agents for QA, security, documentation, and credential management.

## Overview

The Claude Orchestra consists of:

- **1 Chief Architect** (Opus 4.1) - Makes strategic architecture decisions and coordinates the team
- **5 Coding Specialists** - Expert agents for Python, Swift, Go, Rust, and Flutter
- **3 Integration Specialists** - API Explorer, Salesforce API, and Authentik API experts
- **5 Support Agents** - Documentation, QA/Testing, Security Auditing, Credential Management, and DevOps/Deployment

All agents work in parallel using Claude Code's Task tool with Knowledge Manager coordination for efficient, high-quality development.

## Features

✨ **Hierarchical Coordination** - Architect-led team structure with intelligent task delegation
⚡ **Parallel Execution** - All agents work concurrently for 2.8-4.4x speed improvement
🧠 **Shared Knowledge** - Cross-agent communication via Knowledge Manager with LanceDB vector search
🔒 **Security First** - Built-in security auditing and secure credential management
🎯 **Specialized Experts** - Language-specific agents with deep domain knowledge
📊 **Quality Assurance** - Automated integration testing and code review
📚 **Auto Documentation** - Parallel documentation generation as code is written
🚀 **DevOps Ready** - Automated builds, deployments, and infrastructure as code
💾 **Persistent Memory** - Knowledge base survives conversation compactions

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

The cc-army system uses the built-in Knowledge Manager for coordination. No additional installation needed!

### 2. Deploy Your Army

In Claude Code, simply describe what you want to build:

```
"Build a REST API with user authentication in Python"
```

Claude Code will automatically:
1. Initialize MCP coordination topology
2. Spawn all relevant agents in parallel
3. Architect analyzes and designs the system
4. Coding agents implement features
5. QA creates and runs tests
6. Security audits the code
7. Documentation is generated
8. Credentials are managed securely

## 🌐 Cross-Repository Usage

**The Claude Orchestra works from ANY directory!** You don't need to be in the cc-army repository to use it.

### How It Works

1. **Army configuration** lives in `/Users/brent/git/cc-army/`
2. **Army operates** in your current working directory (wherever you invoke Claude Code)
3. **Auto-detection** triggers army based on task complexity (configured in global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)

### Usage from Any Project

```bash
# Navigate to ANY project directory
cd ~/git/my-awesome-project

# Open Claude Code and describe what you want
# The army automatically deploys if task matches trigger patterns
```

**Example:**
```
You: "Build a Python API with JWT authentication and deploy with Docker"

Claude Code:
✓ Detects complex multi-technology task
✓ Loads army config from cc-army directory
✓ Spawns agents in YOUR project directory
✓ Agents create files in YOUR project
✓ Coordination via Knowledge Manager
```

### Trigger Patterns (Auto-Activation)

The army **automatically activates** for:
- Full-stack applications ("Build a mobile app with backend")
- Multi-technology projects ("Create with Python and Go")
- Complex features ("API with Salesforce integration")
- DevOps tasks ("Deploy to AWS with Kubernetes")
- Enterprise integrations ("Set up Authentik authentication")
- Production systems ("Build with tests, security, and monitoring")

The army **bypasses** for simple tasks:
- Single-file changes ("Fix typo in README")
- Simple queries ("What does this function do?")
- Basic operations ("Run tests", "Check git status")
- Small additions ("Add a comment", "Update .gitignore")

### Explicit Invocation

You can always explicitly request the army:
```
"Use the Claude Orchestra to build this feature"
"Deploy the full army for this task"
```

### Project-Specific Customization

Create a `CLAUDE.md` in your project root to customize army behavior:

```bash
# Copy template to your project
cp /Users/brent/git/cc-army/docs/PROJECT_CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md ~/git/your-project/CLAUDE.md

# Edit to customize agent selection, trigger patterns, tech stack
```

**Example project CLAUDE.md:**
```markdown

## Coordination Protocol

Every agent follows this workflow:

**Before Work:**
```bash
# Review knowledge base for relevant context
node ~/git/cc-army/src/knowledge-manager.js search "task keywords"
node ~/git/cc-army/src/knowledge-manager.js search "architect decisions"
```

**During Work:**
```bash
# Update knowledge base with progress
node ~/git/cc-army/src/knowledge-manager.js store "Edit: [filename] - [changes]" --type edit --agent [agent-name]
node ~/git/cc-army/src/knowledge-manager.js store "Progress: [status]" --type status --agent [agent-name]
```

**After Work:**
```bash
# Document task completion
node ~/git/cc-army/src/knowledge-manager.js store "Task complete: [task]" --type completion --agent [agent-name]
```

## Performance

- **Agent Spawn**: Instant (parallel execution)
- **Speed**: 2.8-4.4x faster than sequential
- **Token Reduction**: ~32% with Knowledge Manager
- **Coordination Overhead**: Minimal with built-in coordination
